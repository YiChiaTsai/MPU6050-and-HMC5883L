# MPU6050-and-HMC5883L
Acceleration, Gyroscope and Magnetic

Motion detection using MPU 6050
– Use MPU 6050 to detect the vibration of our
hands, and show events on serial terminal.
– For example, you can tie it on your wrist, then
detect the events:
• when you are typing a keyboard,
• when you are shaking,
• when you are using a smartphone touchscreen, • when you are writing on a piece of paper, etc.

In the battle, sometimes it is difficult to estimate the distance of two objects in enemy's field. Please design a distance estimator for this purpose. As shown in the Figure below, we want to know the distance between A and B. Please use ultrasonic sensor to measure the distances of AC and BC, and use HMC 5883L to estimate the angle of ∠ACB.

Steps (you are in point C):
1. Press button to measure the distance of AC
2. Rotate from pointing to A to pointing to B
3. Press button to measure the distance of BC
4. Print out the distance between A and B
Hint: Law of cosines.
